Command line interface for http://musicforprogramming.net/

Convenient when you want music for programming without launching a browser (or have no browser available).

Needs: bash, wget, mpg123

Usage:
./progmusic [-mb]

  <no flag> - plays a random episode
  -m        - let's you choose from a menu of available episodes
  -d        - backgrounds mpg123, so to stop it you need to kill the mpg123 process
