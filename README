Command line interface for http://musicforprogramming.net/

Convenient when you want music for programming without launching a browser (or have no browser available).

Uses mpg123, which it backgrounds, so in order to stop it you need to kill the mpg123 process.

Usage:
./progmusic     - plays a random episode
./progmusic -m  - let's you choose from a menu of available episodes
